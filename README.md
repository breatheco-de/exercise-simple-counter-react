# Create a simple counter Using React.js
<!--endhide-->

A simple counter is the perfect project web you are in your early steps of learning the React.js library.

We are going to create a visual countdown to showcase the concept of [`React Components`](https://4geeks.com/lesson/making-react-components#the-component-props) and how you can leverage component properties (props) to reuse those components easily.

A custom component allows you to "divide and conquer", separating logical and visual challenges into smaller pieces- giving you greater control over the display and functionalities of each part of the web-app.

For example, to create a bootstrap `<Card />` component you'd code this:

```jsx
export default function Card(props){
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <img className="card-img-top" src="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="Card image cap" />
            <div className="card-body">
                <h5 className="card-title">Card title</h5>
                <p className="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and fill the card's content.</p>
                <a href="#" className="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

After declaring it, you can **import** and **use** it in your webapp like this:

```jsx
// Import react into the bundle
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Card from './component/Card.jsx'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector('#root'));
root.render(<App />);

// If you are using a previous version from React v18
// you have to use ReactDOM.render instead of createRoot
// like this:
// ReactDOM.render(<Card />, document.querySelector('#root'));
```

> üí° Note how `ReactDOM.createRoot` is a function you have to use only one time in your entire application

Additionally, you can pass information through the Card component using **props**:

```jsx
// Use of the custom component
<Card imageUrl="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150" title="A nice image" />
```

For usage within the render method of your Card component (notice the image src and card title):

```jsx
// Declaration of a custom component (Card.jsx)

export default function Card(props){
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <img className="card-img-top" src={props.imageUrl} alt="Card image cap" />
            <div className="card-body">
                <h5 className="card-title">{props.title}</h5>
                <p className="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and fill the card's content.</p>
                <a href="#" className="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## üå± How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```text
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello
```

**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## üìù Instructions

Create a seconds-counter component, called `SecondsCounter`. It should look [like this one](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-simple-counter-react/blob/master/preview.gif).

- The whole purpose of the component is to display how many seconds have passed since the website finished loading (onLoad).
- Use the [***ReactDOM.createRoot***](https://4geeks.com/lesson/react-createroot-vs-render) to render the component into the web-app.
- Use the ***setInterval()*** function to re-render the component every second.
- The component does not need a local state, you can pass the number of seconds as **props**, like this:

```jsx
<SecondsCounter seconds={3434} />
```

- You can find the clock icon on the left of the component in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## üî• Bonus

- Create an option to countdown from a given number.
- Create stop, reset, and resume functionality.
- Create an alert when the user reaches a specified time. If the user enters "10", an alert should render, notifying the user that their time was reached.
